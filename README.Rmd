## R Package: Counting Missing Data
#### Introduction
This repository is for my assignment of STAT 545B in UBC. Using the prebake file provided by my instructors, I created an R package "CountingMissingData" that contains a function that allows the users count the missing values for all columns by groups.

####Installation
You can install the development version of CountMissingData from GitHub with:

```{r}
# install.packages("CountMissingData")
pak::pak("stat545ubc-2025/CountMissingData")
```

####Example
This is a simple example to demonstrate how you can use this package:
This example computes the number of missing values in the `airquality` dataset grouped by the `cyl` column. 

```{r} 
library(CountMissingData)
library(tidyverse)
count_all_missing_by_group(airquality, Month)
```
